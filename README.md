# ALERTOGO 
URL: https://comp1800pj.web.app/ 

## 1. Project Description

ALERTOGO is a commuter’s virtual bulletin board for real-time information on all SkyTrain stations in Metro Vancouver. The app provides updates on station conditions, service interruptions, post-incident reports, crowdedness, police incidents, and more. This information is contributed by users and published on the app. We believe ALERTOGO will help users have a safer and more informed transit experience.

User can:

- Post incidents they witness.
- Look up incidents at station from station list page
- Search station by name
- Add stations into saved
